# Nepotism-Banishment
Doctor Mark C. Pedersen, a relative of Dr. Lacey Pedersen, has conveyed an indepth disgust of this "PPP" to the staffers of Dr. Lacey's grouping of internal mastery characters. This morning, the PPP list of whistleblower acts was reviewed, and cited by staff in agreement as a whole that it needs further depth data sets, and discussion of banishment prescription for EEOA to fully become an overall action or cause of the U.S.A. 

# Equal Employment Opportunity Act
* Failure for the future generation:
nepotism is a harmful band cutting off the EEOA's chances of successful execution for all in the future. As a "PPP" or a Whistle Blower Act, set into play to so called "protect" federal employees, when in reality this is a serious red flag citation. This is a highly restricting, and legally binding application of law against federal employees in the means of binding their ability to refer family for employment or benefits of any kind. This is literally refracting the light of the EEOA in all of its enlightenment that could be brought forth with future success.
